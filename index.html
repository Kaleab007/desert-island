    <p> The Island:

      “It was roughly boat-shaped: humped near this end with behind them the jumbled descent to the shore. On either side rocks, cliffs, treetops and a steep slope: forward there, the length of the boat, a tamer descent, tree-clad, with hints of pink: and then the jungly flat of the island, dense green, but drawn at the end to a pink tail”  </p>
    <p>Located in the southern part of the ocean.</p>
    <p>Its very humid with unbearable heat during the summer season. During the winter season it is high tide with unstoppable storms.</p>

    <p>The wildlife here is mild. Though we have seen a few poisonous snakes,the rest of the wildlife is non-threating to humans. My favorite ones are the Squirrel Monkey and Spider Monkey. They are shy but when they get used to you they are very enjoyable to spend time with.  </p>
